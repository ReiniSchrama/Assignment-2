title: "Assignment 2"

General considerations website layout:  
Data about the bribe; time, place, amount, category, etc. is available from the main search page.  
The full text describing the event is only available from the link itself. 
Can get most of the data from the main "search", without having to go through every link that has been pulled  


Let's generate and scrape the links of the reports first
```{r}
install.packages("rvest")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("xml2")
library("rvest")
library("dplyr")
library("xml2")


df <- data_frame(LINKS = character(),TITLES = character()) #Initialize dataframe with the desired data columns
dftemp <- data_frame() #Create an empty dataframe
for (i in 0:99) { #loop through first 100 pages, 10 results per page = 1000 
 HYPERLINK <- paste("http://www.ipaidabribe.com/reports/paid?page=",i*10, sep = "") #Create hyperlink based on loop function
 print(paste("processing", i, sep = " ")) #progress report
 MY.LINK <- read_html(HYPERLINK, encoding = "UTF-8") #define the static part of link references
 LINKS <- MY.LINK %>% html_nodes(".heading-3 a") %>% html_attr(name = 'href') #define the variable pulled from the site, this returns a 10x1 character vector of hyperlinks
 TITLES <- MY.LINK %>% html_nodes(".heading-3 a") %>% html_text() #vector of titles of bribe
 dftemp <- cbind(TITLES,LINKS) #bind the variables together into a 10 by n dataframe
 df <- rbind(df,dftemp) #bind the rows of df and dftemp together, appending dftemp to df based on column headers, as dftemp is redefined with each step, df grows
 Sys.sleep(1) #timer, wait 1 second
 cat(" done!\n") #progress report
}

#Steps to do:
#Add the remaining variables to pull from the main search in order to construct database
#clean the data as necessary



#Stuff from lectures below

scrape_jp = function(link){
 my.link = read_html(link, encoding = "UTF-8")
 my.link.name = my.link %>% 
   html_nodes(".heading-3 a") %>% html_text() %>% 
   paste(collapse = "")
 my.link.amount = my.link %>% 
   html_nodes(".paid-amount span") %>% html_text()
 return(cbind( my.link.name, link, my.link.amount ))

}

library("plyr")
df = ldply(my.jp.data)
df$article = jp.data.clean[1:5]
head(df, 2)


 .heading-3 a
 .paid-amount span
 .views
 .location
 .name a
